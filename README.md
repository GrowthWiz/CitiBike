# CitiBike Data Quest
## Objective
### This analysis aims to extract insights from a 2013 bike-sharing dataset, exploring user behaviors, station patterns, and trip characteristics. The goal is to derive valuable information that may inform urban mobility strategies, while acknowledging the potential impact of changes in technology and infrastructure since the dataset's collection.
## Data
The dataset provides information on individual bike-sharing trips. Key fields include : 
trip_id, bike_id, weekday, start_hour, start_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_time, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, trip_duration, subscriber, birth_year, and gender.

## Data	Limitation	
### Missing	data	can	limit	the	completeness	and	accuracy	of	analyses.	
### There	are	instances	where	the	user	is	identified	as	a	"non-subscriber,"	and	the	"birth_year"	is	marked	as	"NA."	This	lack	of	information	may	limit	demographic	analysis	and	understanding	of	user	characteristics. 
### The	dataset,	dating	back	to	2013,	may	not	reflect	current	bike-sharing	trends,	user	behaviors,	or	urban	dynamics.	Findings	should	be	interpreted	with	caution,	considering	potential	changes	in	technology,	infrastructure,	and	user	patterns	over	time.	
### The	dataset	seems	to	be	specific	to	a	particular	location	(New	York	City).	Findings	and	patterns	identified	in	this	dataset	may	not	be	applicable	to	other	cities	or	regions.	
## Questions To Explore 
Ridership Flow Rate:
What hours have the most ridership flow rate?
Day of the Week and Age Groups:
Which day of the week is more popular for which age group?
Which month would be best to advertise for specific age groups?
